[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/angel-dart/graphql.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/angel-dart/graphql)

A complete implementation of the official
[GraphQL specification](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/#sec-Language),
in the Dart programming language.

The goal of this project is to provide to server-side
users of Dart an alternative to REST API's.

Included is also
`package:angel_graphql`, which, when combined with the
[Angel](https://github.com/angel-dart) framework, allows
server-side Dart users to build backends with GraphQL and
virtually any database imaginable.
